# Telecom-Churn-prediction

## Business problem overview
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

## Understanding Data
### Understanding the business objective and the data
The dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months - June, July, August and September. The months are encoded as 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively. 

The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To do this task well, understanding the typical customer behaviour during churn will be helpful.

## Modelling
Build models to predict churn. The predictive model that youâ€™re going to build will serve two purposes:
1. It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
2. It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

In some cases, both of the above-stated goals can be achieved by a single machine learning model.
Also, since the rate of churn is typically low (about 5-10%, this is called class-imbalance) - try using techniques to handle class imbalance.

Therefore, build another model with the main objective of identifying important predictor attributes which help the business understand indicators of churn. A good choice to identify important variables is a logistic regression model or a model from the tree family. In the case of logistic regression, make sure to handle multicollinearity.
After identifying important predictors, display them visually - you can use plots, summary tables etc. - whatever you think best conveys the importance of features.
